<p>I am currently a member of technical staff at <a class="highlight" href="https://modal.com">Modal Labs</a> where I explore the intersection of high-performance computing and machine learning. More broadly, my interests span computer architecture, low-level programming, performance engineering, and scientific computing.</p>

<p>In a previous life, I was a CS PhD student at the <a class="highlight" href="https://illinois.edu">University of Illinois</a>. Before that, I worked at <a class="highlight" href="https://nvidia.com">Nvidia</a>, <a class="highlight" href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, and <a class="highlight" href="https://visa.com">Visa</a>. I received my undergraduate degree from <a class="highlight" href="https://tamu.edu">Texas A&M University</a>.</p>

<p>Some other interests of mine include swimming, national parks, and Sichuan cuisine. I also enjoy classical music<span class="emdash-box">&mdash;</span>in particular, virtuosic pieces such as Conus's <a class="highlight" href="https://youtu.be/_W7_4Rcs_YY">Violin Concerto in E minor</a> and Vieuxtemps's <a class="highlight" href="https://youtu.be/fGzuScdx8Fg">Violin Concerto No. 5</a>, both performed by Jascha Heifetz.</p>
